## :octocat: Git and GitHub

Git is a **distributed Version Control System (VCS)**, which means it is a useful tool for easily tracking changes to your code, collaborating, and sharing. With Git you can track the changes you make to your project so you always have a record of what youâ€™ve worked on and can easily revert back to an older version if need be. It also makes working with others easierâ€”groups of people can work together on the same project and merge their changes into one final source!

GitHub is a way to use the same power of Git all online with an easy-to-use interface. Itâ€™s used across the software world and beyond to collaborate and maintain the history of projects.
